## Introduction

`this` is a keyword in JavaScript which works very differently based on how you are using it.

In this post we'll go through all different possible cases and see how `this` keyword works.

---

## Where `this` points to ?

The reference of `this` depends on where and how you are using it.

Let us take some examples to see where `this` points to.

### Using `this` globally

When you are using `this` globally it points to the global window object.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
console.log(this === window); // true
	`}
/>

### Using `this` inside a function

`this` works differently when your using a regular function v/s using an arrow function.

>
> In arrow functions the reference of `this` depends on the surrounding scope of the function which is accessing `this` keyword.

Don't worry if you didn't fully understand the above definition, we'll see lot of examples to understand them.

Whenever you want to know where `this` points to you can recall the above definition.

Let's take an example to see the difference between using `this` in regular and arrow function.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
btn.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
	console.log(event.target === this); // true
\r
    setTimeout(function () {
    	console.log(event.target === this); // false
    	console.log(this); // window
    }, 2000);
});
    `}
/>

-   At first `this` was pointing to the button but after 2 seconds it points to the window object.

-   Let's see why this is the case.

-   Intially `this` points to the button because button was the one which called the callback function (regular function) when a click event took place.

-   But after 2 seconds another callback function (regular function) is accessing `this` but it points to the window not the button because the callback function is not being invoked by the button.

Let's see what happens if we used an arrow function as callback.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
btn.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
	console.log(event.target === this); // true
\r
    setTimeout(() => {
    	console.log(event.target === this); // true
    	console.log(this); // button
    }, 2000);
});
	`}
/>

-   Now `this` points to the same button even after 2 seconds.

-   Try to recall the definition of `this` in an arrow function to know why this is the case.

-   It's because the surrounding scope of the callback function is the button, that is why `this` still points to the button.

### Using `this` inside a method

When you are using `this` inside a method, the same rules that are discussed above can be used.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
let obj = {
	name: 'peter',
    showThisOuter() {
    	console.log(this); // object
    	function showThisInner() {
    		console.log(this); // window
    	}
    	showThisInner();
    },
};
\r
obj.showThisOuter();
`}
/>

-   Here the `this` in outer function (regular function) points to the object because the object is the one who is invoking the outer function.

-   And the `this` in the inner function (regular function) is not being invoked by the object so it points to the global window object.

Let's see what happens if we used an arrow function as outer function.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
let obj = {
	name: 'peter',
	showThisOuter: () => {
		console.log(this); // window
		function showThisInner() {
			console.log(this); // window
		}
		showThisInner();
	},
};
\r
obj.showThisOuter();
	`}
/>

-   Here both in outer and inner function the `this` points to the global window object.

-   It's because in the outer function (arrow function) the `this` points to surrounding scope which is the global window object.

-   And the inner function (regular function) is not being invoked by the object so `this` points to the global window object.

Let's see what happens if we used an arrow function as inner function.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
let obj = {
	name: 'peter',
	showThisOuter() {
		console.log(this); // object
		let showThisInner = () => {
			console.log(this); // object
		};
		showThisInner();
	},
};
\r
obj.showThisOuter();
	`}
/>

-   In both the outer and inner function the `this` points to the object.

-   In the outer function (regular function) the `this` points to the object because the object is the one who is invoking the outer function.

-   And the `this` in the inner function (arrow function) points to the surrounding scope which is the object.

## Changing the reference of `this`

There are ways to change the reference of `this` using methods like call, apply and bind.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
let obj = {
	name: 'peter',
};
\r
function displayThis() {
	console.log(this === window); // true
	console.log(this === obj); // false
}
\r
displayThis();
	`}
/>

-   Here `this` points to global window object. If you want `this` to point to the object we can use any of the above three mentioned methods.

Let's see all the methods one by one.

### Using call method

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
let obj = {
	name: 'peter',
};
\r
function displayThis(param1, param2) {
	console.log(this === window); // false
	console.log(this === obj); // true
	console.log(param1, param2); // a b
}
\r
displayThis.call(obj, 'a', 'b');
	`}
/>

-   The call method makes `this` inside the function point to the object passed as first argument.

-   And it takes the rest of the parameters of the function as seperate arguments.

### Using apply method

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
let obj = {
	name: 'peter',
};
\r
function displayThis(param1, param2) {
	console.log(this === window); // false
	console.log(this === obj); //true
	console.log(param1, param2); // a b
}
\r
displayThis.apply(obj, ['a', 'b']);
	`}
/>

-   The apply method is same as call it makes `this` inside the function point to the object passed as first argument.

-   But it takes the parameters of the function as a single array passed as second argument.

### Using bind method

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
let obj = {
	name: 'peter',
};
\r
function displayThis(params) {
	console.log(this === window); // false
	console.log(this === obj); // true
	console.log(params); // ["a","b"]
}
\r
let changedThis = displayThis.bind(obj, ['a', 'b']);
changedThis();
	`}
/>

-   The bind method makes `this` inside the function point to the object passed as first argument.

-   It takes the parameters of the function as a single array passed as second argument.

-   And it returns a function with above changes so that you can call them later.

## Conclusion

Here are some of the key takeaways from this post.

-   In the global scope, `this` refers to the global window object.

-   In regular function the value of `this` is determined by who is invoking the function which is accessing `this`.

-   In arrow function the value of `this` is determined by the surrounding scope of the function which is accessing `this`.

-   We can change the reference of `this` using call, apply, and bind.

-   The call and apply can be used when you want to change the reference of `this` while calling the function.

-   The bind can be used when you want a separate function with modified reference of `this`.

-   You can not modify the reference of `this` for arrow functions.
