## Introduction

JavaScript is a prototype based language it uses prototypes for property, method lookup and code re usability through inheritance.

In this post we'll learn about prototypes, prototype chain and prototypical inheritance.

---

## Prototype and prototype chain

In JavaScript there are two types of data one is primitive
(numbers, strings, boolean) and the other is object type (arrays, object literals and functions).

Both the primitive and the object types are wrapped by their respective objects.

-   The numbers are wrapped by `Number`, strings are wrapped by `String`, booleans are wrapped by `Boolean`.

-   The arrays are wrapped by `Array`, objects are wrapped by `Object`, functions are wrapped by `Function`.

All these wrapper objects have a property called prototype.

This prototype is an object which contains all the reusable properties, methods and it also has the prototype of its parent.

The parent of all these wrapper objects is the global object called `Object`.

The chain of objects linked together by the prototypes is called as the prototype chain.

Now let us visualize the prototype chain using an example.

Let's see how this works in code.

To get the prototype of a variable we can use the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
\r
const arrWrapperProto = Object.getPrototypeOf(arr);
\r
console.log(arrWrapperProto); // Array
\r
const objectProto = Object.getPrototypeOf(arrWrapperProto);
\r
console.log(objectProto); // Object
\r
const objectParentProto = Object.getPrototypeOf(objectProto);
\r
console.log(objectParentProto); // null
    `}
/>

## Property, method lookup

Let's see how the property or method lookup works.

-   If you are trying to access a property or method, first JavaScript looks in the current object.

-   If it is not found then using the prototype chain it looks up in the parent object.

-   This continues till the property or method is found or null is reached.

-   This is how the lookup for property or method takes place.

---

## Prototypical inheritance

The main use case of prototypes is to reuse code by inheritance.

And the inheritance is possible because of the prototype chain.

Let's take an example to understand.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
const person = {
  isTalkative: true,
  talk() {
    console.log("Talking...");
  },
};
\r
const student = {
  name: "John",
  age: 12,
};
\r
Object.setPrototypeOf(student, person);
\r
console.log(student.name); // John
\r
console.log(student.isTalkative); // true
\r
student.talk(); // Talking...
\r
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(student) === person); // true
    `}
/>

-   Here we are using the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` and setting the prototype of the student as person.

-   This means that the protoype of student will be person or in other words the student prototypically inherits the properties and methods from the person.

-   Due to this the student will have access to all the properties and methods in person.

Let's visualize the prototype chain for the above example.

<Image

	alt="Prototypical Inheritance"
	sizes={['10rem']}
/>

-   Here the prototype of student is person, the prototype of person is `Object` and the prototype of `Object` is null.

-   This means that the student will have access to all the properties and methods from person and `Object`.

-   Similarly the person will have access to all the properties and methods from the `Object`.

## Creating objects

Now that we have learnt about prototypes let us see how to create our own objects using prototypes.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
function Student(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
\r
Student.prototype.isTalkative = true;
\r
Student.prototype.talk = function () {
  console.log("Talking...");
};
\r
const john = new Student("John", 12);
\r
console.log(john.age); // 12
\r
john.talk(); // Talking...
    `}
/>

-   Here the student function is used to construct or create an object so it is called as `constructor function`.

-   It is a common convention that the constructor functions should have upper camel casing to identify them as constructors.

-   The `this` keyword points to the object that is created.

</Alert>

-   Note that the arrow functions can not be used to create constructor functions.

-   We are setting the property and method in the prototype of the function so that all the objects will be able to access them by prototypical inheritance.

-   The `new` keyword is used to create objects using the constructor function.

-   The `Object.create()` method is used to create objects from object literals.

Let's see how to create objects from object literals.

<CodeBlock
	language="js"
	code={`
const person = {
  isHappy: true,
  introduce() {
    console.log(\`Hi I'm \${this.name}\`);
  },
};
\r
const john = Object.create(person);
\r
john.name = "John";
\r
console.log(john.isHappy); // true
john.introduce(); // Hi I'm John
\r
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(john) === person); // true
    `}
/>

-   Here the `Object.create()` method sets the prototype of john as person object.

		Note that in ES6, classes was introduced to JavaScript and they are used to create objects,
		but it is just a change in the syntax and behind the scenes it still uses prototype based
		inheritance.

## Conclusion

Here are some of the key takeaways from this post.

-   Everything in JavaScript has a wrapper object which contains the prototype property.

-   Prototype is an object that contains all the reusable properties, methods along with the prototype of its parent.

-   Prototype chain is the chain of objects linked by the prototypes.

-   JavaScript uses the prototype chain to lookup properties and methods.

-   Prototypical inheritance is the ability to reuse the properties and methods from the parent objects in the prototype chain.
